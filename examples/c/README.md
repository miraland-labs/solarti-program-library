# Program examples written in C

The examples in this directory demonstrate various Miraland program mechanisms.
They are for code reference only and are not end-to-end working examples. The
current C test frameworks are very limited so not all functionality is fully
tested.

## Environment Setup

1. Install `make`
2. Install gcc
3. Install Miraland v1.4.6 or later from
   https://docs.miraland.io/cli/install-miraland-cli-tools

## Build and Test

To build the examples and run the tests:

```bash
$ make
```

## Audit

The repository [README](https://github.com/miraland-labs/miraland-program-library#audits)
contains information about program audits.
